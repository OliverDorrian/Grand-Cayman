                  The capital city of The Cayman Islands is George Town, which
                  also contains the main seaport and airport. The main tourist
                  stretch is Seven Mile Beach, which straddles West Bay and
                  George Town. The eastern part of Grand Cayman is the up and

                <p>
                  George Town on Grand Cayman is a popular cruise ship
                  destination, on days when there are many ships visiting, the
                  town and tourist attractions get very busy. You can find out
                  which days those are by checking the Cayman Islands Department
                  of Tourism's website or the Grand Cayman Visitor's Guide.

                  Beyond the glitz and glam of George Town and the crowds at
                  Seven Mile Beach, there’s a lot to explore in Grand Cayman –
                  exquisite local flora and fauna, hidden beaches tucked away
                  from tourist foot traffic, and museums nestled into historic
                  homes, giving a glimpse into the island’s British heritage.
